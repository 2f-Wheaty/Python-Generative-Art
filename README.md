# Python genertated art

A repository containing all of the python genertated art. Some of the code is not made by me. I will not take credit for what was not me. Some of the code I used from others is:
1. The folder "machine-psychology-python-art" made by the amazing folks at [Pixegami-team](https://github.com/pixegami-team/machine-psychology-python-art)
2. The folder "samila" was made by [sepandhaghighi](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/samila)


#### If you want to use my code...
All I ask is for some credit and not to be ripped off.
